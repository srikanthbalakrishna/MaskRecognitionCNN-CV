# MaskRecognitionCNN-CV
[Project In-progress]<br>
test_hyperparameter_tuned.ipynb: code was taken from Hussain Mujtaba from his blog post on Face Mask Detection using OpenCV <br>
I did the Model training after hyperparameter optimization using the keras-tuner module. 

Run *'test_hyperparameter_tuned.ipynb'* with the trained model *'.h5'* file in the corresponding directory and see how it works!<br>
